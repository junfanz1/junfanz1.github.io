## __Bio__

My name is Junfan Zhu (Chinese characters below).

![eb028265fa024f1480bef5dab2034fdd](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56275127/119562808-64c9da80-bd6c-11eb-990c-983fe77af963.png)

I grow up in 无锡 ([Wuxi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuxi)), a beautiful cultural city in China.

Currently, I'm an Analyst at Societe Generale in Chicago. I received M.S. degree in Financial Mathematics from the [University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/) in 2020 December. 

My interests lie in Quant Research/Trading, Machine Learning and Computer Science.

## __Experiences__

- (2020 Oct - Dec) I was a Quantitative Project Researcher at Belvedere Trading, building stochastic models for S&P volatility term structure analysis. 

- (2020 Jun - Sept) I interned at Societe Generale. I researched on Variational Autoencoder, robust regression's applications on quanto futures Monte Carlo analysis. In Sinovation Venture, I digged microstructure features with Refinitiv’s 20-year Forex tick data with ElasticNet, GBRT, CatBoost, LightGBM for multivariate time series, and to forecast order book dispersion’s micro-price.

- (2020 Apr - Jun) I was an OMM Quant Researcher in a prop trading firm (with recognition), where I applied dynamic SABR with Stochastic Gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (SGHMC, ICML’2014), and enhanced fitness performance by Functional Data Analysis (FDA). I compared Carr-Wu model with Stochastic Volatility Inspired (SVI) and optimized volatility surface with Nadaraya-Waston kernel estimator and B-spline. 

- (2020 Jan - Apr) In UChicago Statistics, I researched on High Frequency Data in Microstructure Noise with Statistical Stochastic PDEs. I estimated bid-ask imbalance indicators including VWAP, TSRV, minRV, VPIN microstructure for Toxic Order Flow risk metrics. 

- (2019 Oct - Dec) I was an NLP Researcher in a trading firm, where I built a hybrid-sentiment trading signaling model.
