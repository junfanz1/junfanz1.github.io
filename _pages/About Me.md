## __Bio__

Hi, I'm Junfan! I'm currently full time Analyst for 2 years at [Societe Generale](https://americas.societegenerale.com/en/) in Chicago & Paris risk models team, working on derivatives volatility modeling and pricing, time series data analytics machine learning on cloud services. I graduated with [MS. Financial Mathematics](https://finmath.uchicago.edu/) from [UChicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/) in December 2020, and expect to graduate with [MS. Computer Science](https://omscs.gatech.edu/) from [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/) in 2023 June. My interests are Quant Research/Trading, Machine Learning and Computer Science. 

- 2020 Fall, before full time at SocGen, I was a Quantitative Project Researcher at Belvedere Trading, building stochastic models for S&P volatility term structure analysis. 
- 2020 summer, I interned at Societe Generale, where I applied Variational Autoencoder and robust regression to quanto futures Monte Carlo simulations. 
- In Sinovation Venture Deep Learning program, I digged microstructure features with Refinitiv’s 20-year Forex tick data with ElasticNet, GBRT, CatBoost, LightGBM for multivariate time series, and to forecast order book dispersion’s micro-price. 
- 2020 Spring, I was an OMM Quantitative Project Researcher in a Chicago prop trading firm and received recognition, where I applied dynamic SABR with Stochastic Gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and enhanced fitness performance by Functional Data Analysis (FDA), compared Carr-Wu model with Stochastic Volatility Inspired (SVI), optimized volatility surface with Nadaraya-Waston kernel estimator and B-spline. 
- In UChicago Statistics, I researched on High Frequency Data in Microstructure Noise with Statistical Stochastic PDEs, modeling bid-ask imbalance indicators including VWAP, TSRV, minRV, VPIN microstructure for Toxic Order Flow risk metrics. 
- 2019 Fall, I was an NLP Project Researcher in a Chicago trading firm, where I built a hybrid-sentiment trading signaling model. 

I’m proficient in `Python`, `R`, `SQL`, Machine Learning; intermediate in `C++`, `Java`, `Spark`, `Linux`, `Cuda` and Cloud Native. I ranked Top 10 Algorithmic Trader in Rotman International Trading Competition, Top 10% in Citadel Datathon. I was awarded Outstanding Bachelor Thesis (Top 1%), Meritorious Winner in International Mathematical Contest in Modeling, Second Prize in Asia Supercomputing Challenge.

I grow up in 无锡 ([Wuxi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuxi)), a beautiful cultural city in China. Now I live in Chicago.

I love travelling, traveled to 46 States and 13 National Parks in USA (more to go :D) 

- East in Maine; 
- West in Unalaska and Cold Bay in Aleutian islands; 
- North in Alaska Arctic Circle; 
- South in Hawaii, Puerto Rico and Key West.

- Waikoloa, Hawaii Big Island; 
- Honolulu, Hawaii Oahu Island; 
- Old San Juan, Puerto Rico; 
- Culebra, Puerto Rico; 
- Esperanza, Vieques of Puerto Rico; 
- Portland, Oregon; 
- Avalon, Santa Catalina Island of California; 
- Stowe, Vermont; 
- Bar Harbor, Maine. 

I travel by [Amtrak](https://www.amtrak.com/) - California Zephyr, Coast Starlight, Southwest Chief, Empire Builder, Pacific Surfliner are among the best 5 in my heart, I also experienced Crescent, Capitol Limited, Texas Eagle, etc. 

I completed a Marathon in 4h'55min. My hobbies are bartending, open water diving, private pilot, skiing, trekking, Chinese Calligraphy, Violin, Kunqu Opera and I'm a big fan of AoT (Attack on Titan). I love reading and keep [notes](https://github.com/junfanz1/Douban) on humanities and arts.
