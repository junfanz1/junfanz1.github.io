I'm currently an Analyst at Societe Generale. I earned my M.S. in Financial Mathematics from UChicago in December 2020. 

My interests lie in Quant Research / Trading, Machine Learning.

__Previous Experiences__

- 2020 Oct - Dec, I was a Quantitative Project Researcher at Belvedere Trading, building stochastic models for S&P volatility term structure analysis. 

- 2020 Jun - Sept, I interned at Societe Generale. I researched on Variational Autoencoder, robust regression's applications on quanto futures Monte Carlo analysis. In Sinovation Venture, I digged microstructure features with Refinitiv’s 20-year Forex tick data with ElasticNet, GBRT, CatBoost, LightGBM for multivariate time series, and to forecast order book dispersion’s micro-price.

- 2020 Apr - Jun, I was an OMM Quant Researcher in a prop trading firm (with recognition), where I applied dynamic SABR with Stochastic Gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (SGHMC, ICML’2014), and enhanced fitness performance by Functional Data Analysis (FDA). I compared Carr-Wu model with Stochastic Volatility Inspired (SVI) and optimized volatility surface with Nadaraya-Waston kernel estimator and B-spline. 

- 2020 Jan - Apr, In UChicago Statistics, I researched on High Frequency Data in Microstructure Noise with Statistical Stochastic PDEs. I estimated bid-ask imbalance indicators including VWAP, TSRV, minRV, VPIN microstructure for Toxic Order Flow risk metrics. 

- 2019 Oct - Dec, I was an NLP Researcher in a trading firm, where I built a hybrid-sentiment trading signaling model. 

- 2018 Jan - Mar, I was a Big Data Intern at KPMG.

__Coding Skills__

I’m proficient in Python, R, SQL; intermediate in C++, Spark, kdb+, Cuda. I hold certificates of Triplebyte Certified Machine Learning Engineer, Coursera Deep Learning & NLP & Probabilistic Graphical Models Specializations, Bloomberg Market Concepts. 

In Rotman International Trading Competition, I ranked Top 10 Algorithmic Trader. I have honors including Outstanding Bachelor Thesis (Top 1%), Meritorious Winner in International Mathematical Contest in Modeling, and Second Prize in Asia Supercomputing Challenge, Top 10% in Citadel Datathon. 

__Interesting Facts__

I completed a Marathon in 4h'55min. I love skiing, trekking (Nepal Annapurna Base Camp, Inner-Mongolia Kubuqi Desert), Chinese Calligraphy, Violin, Kunqu Opera, law (took China Bar Exam), and cooking.
