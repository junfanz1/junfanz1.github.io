## __Bio__

My name is Junfan Zhu. I grow up in 无锡 ([Wuxi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuxi)), a beautiful cultural city in China.

I love travelling, traveled 46 States and 13 National Parks in USA (more to go :D) - East in Maine; West in Unalaska and Cold Bay in Aleutian islands; North in Alaska Arctic Circle; South in Hawaii, Puerto Rico and Key West. 

My favorite 12 beautiful towns in USA are: Kodiak, Alaska; Seward, Alaska; Homer, Alaska; Waikoloa, Hawaii Big Island; Honolulu, Hawaii Oahu Island; Old San Juan, Puerto Rico; Culebra, Puerto Rico; Esperanza, Vieques of Puerto Rico; Portland, Oregon; Avalon, Santa Catalina Island of California; Stowe, Vermont; Bar Harbor, Maine.

Since I live in Chicago, I also travelled by [Amtrak trains](https://www.amtrak.com/) - California Zephyr, Coast Starlight, Southwest Chief, Empire Builder, Pacific Surfliner are among the best 5; Crescent, Capitol Limited, Texas Eagle, etc. 

I completed a Marathon in 4h'55min. My hobbies are bartending, open water diving, private pilot, skiing, trekking, Chinese Calligraphy, Violin, Kunqu Opera and I'm a big fan of AoT (Attack on Titan). I love reading and keep [notes](https://github.com/junfanz1/Douban) on humanities and arts.

I'm currently an Analyst at [Societe Generale](https://americas.societegenerale.com/en/) in Chicago. I graduated with [MS. Financial Mathematics](https://finmath.uchicago.edu/) from [UChicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/) in December 2020, and expected to graduate with [MS. Computer Science](https://omscs.gatech.edu/) from [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/) in 2023 June. My interests are Quant Research/Trading, Machine Learning and Computer Science. 

Before full time at SocGen, I was a Quantitative Project Researcher at Belvedere Trading, building stochastic models for S&P volatility term structure analysis. In 2020 summer, I interned at Societe Generale. I researched on Variational Autoencoder, robust regression's applications on quanto futures Monte Carlo analysis. In Sinovation Venture Deep Learning program, I digged microstructure features with Refinitiv’s 20-year Forex tick data with ElasticNet, GBRT, CatBoost, LightGBM for multivariate time series, and to forecast order book dispersion’s micro-price. 

In 2020 Spring, I was an OMM Quant Researcher Intern in a prop trading firm (with recognition), where I applied dynamic SABR with Stochastic Gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (SGHMC, ICML’2014), and enhanced fitness performance by Functional Data Analysis (FDA). I compared Carr-Wu model with Stochastic Volatility Inspired (SVI) and optimized volatility surface with Nadaraya-Waston kernel estimator and B-spline. In UChicago Statistics, I researched on High Frequency Data in Microstructure Noise with Statistical Stochastic PDEs. I estimated bid-ask imbalance indicators including VWAP, TSRV, minRV, VPIN microstructure for Toxic Order Flow risk metrics. In 2019 Oct-Dec, I was an NLP Researcher in a trading firm, where I built a hybrid-sentiment trading signaling model. I have experiences as Big Data Intern at KPMG, and Top 10% in Citadel Datathon.

I’m proficient in `Python`, `R`, `SQL`; intermediate in `C++`, `Spark`, `Linux`, `Cuda`, Cloud Native. I hold certificates of Triplebyte Certified Machine Learning Engineer, Coursera Deep Learning & NLP & Probabilistic Graphical Models Specializations, Bloomberg Market Concepts. In Rotman International Trading Competition, I ranked Top 10 Algorithmic Trader. I have honors including Outstanding Bachelor Thesis (Top 1%), Meritorious Winner in International Mathematical Contest in Modeling, and Second Prize in Asia Supercomputing Challenge.
